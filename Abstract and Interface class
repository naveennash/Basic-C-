Abstract class - It is a Half defined parent class in which, some of the implementations are left for the child class to be defined.

using System;

public abstract class Vehicle{
    public abstract void drive();
}

public class Car:Vehicle{
    public override void drive(){
        Console.WriteLine("Let's Drive");
    }
}

public class Program{
    public static void Main(){
        Vehicle vec = new Car();
        vec.drive();
    }
}

Interface - It is the contract between developer who is developing a code and the consumer who is consuming the code.Logic cannot be defined in interface and always holds the access modifier public

using System;

public interface Vehicle{
    void drive();
}

public class Car:Vehicle{
    public void drive(){
        Console.WriteLine("Let's drive Interface");
    }
}

public class Program{
    static void Main(){
        Vehicle vec = new Car();
        vec.drive();
    }
}
